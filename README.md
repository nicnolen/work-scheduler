# Work Scheduler

## Description
Created a sschedule for workday hours (between 9 AM and 5pm) that allows users to input a task in a time slot. Time slots in the past are listed in gray, the current time slot is listed in red, and future time slots are listed in green. This makes it easy for users to know what times they are available, as well as visualize which task deadlines are approaching and prioritize those tasks
